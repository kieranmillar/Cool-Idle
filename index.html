				<p>Welcome to Cool Idle!</p>
				<p>Click on the tabs above to swap locations.</p>
				<p>This page tells you all you need to know to play the game. Come back as you unlock more gameplay features to learn how they work!</p>

				<hr>
				<h2>Level and Experience</h2>

				<p>The aim of the game is to increase your level. At the top of the screen you will see your level and the experience needed to reach the next level. Interacting with the gameplay features you unlock will lead to ways to gain more experience.</p>
				<p>As your level goes up, parts of each gameplay feature will become more powerful. Progress in each feature so you can gain experience and improve your level, which will in turn have an impact on all features.</p>

				<hr>
				<h2>Coins</h2>
				<p>At the top of your screen you will find 3 types of coins:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yellow coins: A common currency you can earn in each feature.</li>
					<li>Green coins: A rarer currency that you only earn in features by performing more difficult tasks.</li>
					<li>Blue coins: These coins can only be earned by levelling up. When you level up you earn a number of blue coins equal to the level you just left, e.g. when levelling up from level 4 to level 5, you earn 4 blue coins.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Coins are spent in Cool-Mart to unlock and upgrade game features!</p>

					<h2>Kingdom</h2>
					<p><strong>Level bonus:</strong> All building outputs are multiplied by your level.</p>
					<p>Build and place buildings which produce resources every second. Use these resources to build more buildings, or unlock upgrades. The output of buildings can often be improved by building them on, or next to, various terrain features or other buildings. The resources produced by buildings can also include experience and coins.</p>
