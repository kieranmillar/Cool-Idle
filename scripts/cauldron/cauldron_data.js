/*Array of data structures for buildings
-----
idNumber: The idNumber according to its position in the array. cauldron_buildingEnum should match this
name: String containing displayed building name.
id: String containing the html id for the container div in the building panel
imageLink: The name of the image stored in ../images/cauldron/
idLink: should be included but set to null. cauldron_init() will set this to the html container div element so we don't have to search the DOM for it again
valueLink: should be included but set to null. cauldron_init() will set this to the html span element so we don't have to search the DOM for it again
buildButtonLink: should be included but set to null. cauldron_init() will set this to the html build button element so we don't have to search the DOM for it again
output: A lambda function that is called by cauldron_calculateOutput(). Returns the amount of magic a single copy of that building will produce.
onPurchase: A lambda function that is called by cauldron_build(). Applies bonus effect when you build a building.
unlocked: Boolean if the building has been unlocked. This should show the unlock state at the start of a new game, cauldron_unlocks() may change it later
description: A lambda function returning the html of the description
cost: A data objects detailing each resourcethe cost for this building:
--base: The amount of magic needed for the first time you build this building
--factor: A multiplier for how much the cost increases each time you build this building
--link: should be included but set to null. cauldron_init() will set this to the html resource value element so we don't have to search the DOM for it again
